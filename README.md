## Local Setup

For a local setup, you can use `uv` to manage your Python environment and run the application.

1.  **Install uv**:
    If you don't have `uv` installed, you can install it by following the official instructions at [https://github.com/astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).
    A common way to install it is:
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```

2.  **Run the application**:
    Once `uv` is installed, you can run the Gradio application using:
    ```bash
    uv run app.py
    ```
